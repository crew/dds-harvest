Dependencies
============
- Python 2.4+
- python-pip
- python-setuptools

Setup
=====
in the this directory, run

  sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

That'll download the right versions of software harvest depends on.
Run

  sudo ./setup.py install

That'll install harvest as a command 'dds-server' on your machine.
It'll also install harvest's configuration file to
'/etc/dds-server.conf'. Edit it and replace

  username: test2
  password: test2

with a username and password for the the xmpp server you'll
be using. The default server is dds-master.ccs.neu.edu.
If you haven't already, set up an account there, harvest will
automatically create your account on the server. Replace

  dds-path: /

with

  dds-path: /full/path/to/backend

that is, replace '/' with the absolute path to your checkout
of orwell. Harvest depends on code and configuration files
from orwell, specifically the database configuration. It's
important that in your 'local_settings.py' file in orwell, if
you use sqlite3, the DATABASE_NAME variable is a full path
to the database file orwell uses. If it's just a name, like
for instance 'orwell.db', harvest will create a database itself
in this directory. The database will be unpopulated of course, so
it'll die on startup.

Finally, if you wish for dds-backend to start with your machine
ensure that you run

    update-rc.d harvest defaults

to add the init script to your initrc

Running
=======
Make sure orwell has already been set up and is running. Run

  dds-server

The harvest process will detach from your shell and run on
its own. If you'd like to have it attached to your shell and
display logging information, run

  dds-server --nodaemonize
